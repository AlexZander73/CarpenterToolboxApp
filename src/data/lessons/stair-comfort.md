# Stair Comfort Rules of Thumb

Stair comfort is usually assessed with simple heuristics: comfortable risers and treads create a steady rhythm. A common check is that two risers plus one tread should feel natural in stride. These are heuristics, not code, and must be checked against the NCC and applicable standards.

Use the calculator to explore options, then confirm dimensions with compliance documents. Always account for landings, handrails, and headroom.

**Site tips**
- Build a short mock-up if possible.
- Keep riser heights consistent across the flight.
- Check for floor finish thickness changes.
