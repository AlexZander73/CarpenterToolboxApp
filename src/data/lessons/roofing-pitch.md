# Roofing Pitch and What the Numbers Mean

Roof pitch is the relationship between rise and run. A pitch of 1:4 means the roof rises 1 unit for every 4 units of run. This matters for drainage, headroom, and material selection.

When translating pitch to degrees, you are converting a ratio into an angle. Keep your rise and run measurements in the same unit and confirm whether plans refer to span or run.

**Site tips**
- Use pitch gauges to confirm angles before cutting.
- Double-check run is half the span for gable roofs.
- Keep pitch notes with your cut list.
