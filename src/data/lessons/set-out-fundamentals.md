# Set-out Fundamentals

Set-out is the process of transferring measurements from drawings to the site. Start with a reliable baseline, confirm dimensions against the plan, and use a square reference for all critical lines. Keep your work tidy and re-check key points before moving on.

The most common errors come from small misreads that compound over long distances. Break long lines into manageable measurements and check diagonals to confirm squareness.

**Site tips**
- Snap a clean chalk line for baseline references.
- Mark both sides of a line when clearances are tight.
- Re-check set-out after trades have worked through the area.
