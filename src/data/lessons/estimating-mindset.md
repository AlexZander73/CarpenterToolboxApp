# Estimating Mindset: Allowances, Waste, Cuts

Good estimating is about repeatable habits. Start with clean measurements, add an allowance for cutting and defects, and round up to order sizes. Track what actually gets used so your future estimates improve.

Waste is not just offcuts. It includes damaged pieces, unusable defects, and time lost to short runs. Build a simple waste factor that reflects the complexity of the job.

**Site tips**
- Record actual usage after each job.
- Use higher waste on complex trims and irregular areas.
- Keep separate notes for fasteners and adhesives.
