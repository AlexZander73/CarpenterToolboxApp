# Right Triangles on Site

Right triangles show up everywhere: rafters, bracing, and set-out diagonals. When you know two sides of a right triangle, Pythagoras gives you the third. This is a dependable way to confirm squareness and check framing lengths.

Keep your rise and run measured from the same points. Even small offsets will throw the result. Once you have the hypotenuse, compare it to a direct tape measurement as a reality check.

**Site tips**
- Use consistent datum points for rise and run.
- Verify with a physical measurement before cutting.
- Keep a small notebook of common right triangle lengths.
