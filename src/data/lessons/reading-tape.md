# Reading a Tape Measure (Metric)

Understanding a metric tape measure is a core site skill. Each large number represents a full metre, and the smaller numbered marks show centimetres. The smallest marks are millimetres. Focus on three habits: align the hook correctly, keep the tape straight, and read from the same reference edge every time.

When working fast, call out measurements in millimetres to avoid confusion. For example, say "two four hundred" instead of "two point four metres." Consistency reduces errors across a crew.

**Site tips**
- Hook the tape firmly and pull to remove slack.
- If the hook is bent, account for the error or replace the tape.
- Use a pencil tick and a square to transfer measurements cleanly.
